# This American Scraper

_This American Life’s_ archives are available to stream [online][1] for free or
for $2.99 through the official app ([App Store][2], [Google Play][3]).

Unfortunately, no official method exists for listening to the archive through
the ever-growing ecosystem of podcast apps. This is a problem for those of us
who rely on features present in those other apps — like Android Auto
support — or find the app to be buggier or harder to use than the alternatives.

This script scrapes the public TAL website and generates an RSS feed for use
with other podcast apps. You can subscribe to the feed committed to the
repository via [github][4] or [gitcdn][5].
